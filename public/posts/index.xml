      <description>We have decided to start a new fund that focuses on IPO stocks. We will call the fund &amp;ldquo;The IPO Fund&amp;rdquo;.
We decided to build this fund after studying 10 years of IPO data and came to the following conclusions:
  If we had invested in every stock that we knew about that went public since 2010, we would have outperformed the index (S&amp;amp;P500) by more than 130%.
  If we were more selective and invested in stocks that not only we knew about but we also felt confident about, we would have outperformed the index by more than 360%.</description>
